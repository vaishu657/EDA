# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand data patterns, trends, relationships, and insights using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in data science that helps in understanding the structure and characteristics of data before applying machine learning models.  
In this project, various statistical and visualization techniques are used to analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights.

The analysis is implemented using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** environment.
